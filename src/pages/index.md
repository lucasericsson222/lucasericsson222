Itho! I am Lucas Ericsson, an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major at UC Berkeley.
For fun, I compose songs and work with Conlangs, while learning more about programming.

I'm currently learning about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Quantum Computing, but I also enjoy
web design projects.

I am learning [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/) and [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto), 
and I've experimented with creating a conlang through [Ampau'mur](/posts/ampaumur).
